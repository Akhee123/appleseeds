# Apple Seeds

My name is Muhammad. I'm a 26 year old electrical engineer with a passion to learn more about programming and electronics. 
I mostly sepnd my time in my home lab tinkering with electronics and IoT devices. And that's where my experience with programming started. I mostly use C/C++ for embedded appications and Python to get some work done fast.
I applied to Apple Seeds Full Stack Bootcamp to gain knowledge about web applications and their development process.
